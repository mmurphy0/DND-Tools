# DND Skill Roller

## Description
A Python Tkinter App which rolls the stats when creating a d&d character. The program does not add character-specific bonuses which the user is informed about at the end of the program

## Usage
-> The welcome page has a start button to advance onto entering your characters name in the following window

-> The program checks that a name has been entered before moving onto getting the stats for the user. if a name has not been entered a messagebox appears telling the user they must enter a name for their character

-> The next window shows the stats that have been rolled for the character. Below is an export button to export these stats to Skill Roll History.txt so the user can keep them saved with their character name on the document so it is easy to find. Also there is a back button to take the user back to the welcome page

-> When the user clicks the export button they are reminded that character bonuses need to be done by them.

## Tech Stack
-> Python

-> Tkinter

## Future Updates
